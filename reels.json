Well, let's break it down!\"\n\nA computer is an electronic device that processes data and performs tasks based on a set of instructions. It follows a simple cycle:\n‚úÖ Input (You press a key or click a button)\n‚úÖ Processing (The CPU calculates and decides what to do)\n‚úÖ Output (You see the result on the screen)\n\nThe first fully functional computer, called ENIAC, was built in 1945, and it weighed over 27 tons‚Äîbasically the size of a room! Today, your smartphone is millions of times more powerful than those early machines.\n\nComputers are now everywhere‚Äîrunning cars, controlling satellites, and even diagnosing diseases! So next time you use one, just remember‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more than just a screen and keyboard‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerful brain that never sleeps! üíªüöÄ",
