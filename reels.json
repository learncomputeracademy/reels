Today, your smartphone is millions of times more powerful than those early machines.\n\nComputers are now everywhere—running cars, controlling satellites, and even diagnosing diseases! So next time you use one, just remember… it’s more than just a screen and keyboard—it’s a powerful brain that never sleeps! 💻🚀",

Think of it like the body of a car.\n💾 Software is the set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do—like the apps you use, from Chrome to Photoshop. This is like the driver of the car.\n\nWithout hardware, software can’t run. And without software, hardware is just a useless box of circuits. That’s why they must work together!\n\nBy 2030, the global software industry is expected to hit $1 trillion, and without software, we wouldn't have things like AI, mobile apps, or even this video you’re watching right now!

First, it fetches instructions—like, ‘Hey, open this app.’ Then, it decodes them, figuring out what to do. Finally, it executes—making it happen lightning-fast. Modern CPUs can handle billions of these cycles per second. For example, a typical phone CPU today runs at 2-3 GHz—that’s 2 to 3 billion cycles every second!\"\"  \r\n<b style='display: block;'>[1:00-1:30] Fun fact</b><br>\r\n\"\"Back in 1971, the first CPU, the Intel 4004, could only do 92,000 operations per second.
