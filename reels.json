Well, let's break it down!\"\n\nA computer is an electronic device that processes data and performs tasks based on a set of instructions. It follows a simple cycle:\n✅ Input (You press a key or click a button)\n✅ Processing (The CPU calculates and decides what to do)\n✅ Output (You see the result on the screen)\n\nThe first fully functional computer, called ENIAC, was built in 1945, and it weighed over 27 tons—basically the size of a room! Today, your smartphone is millions of times more powerful than those early machines.\n\nComputers are now everywhere—running cars, controlling satellites, and even diagnosing diseases! So next time you use one, just remember… it’s more than just a screen and keyboard—it’s a powerful brain that never sleeps! 💻🚀",

Think of it like the body of a car.\n💾 Software is the set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do—like the apps you use, from Chrome to Photoshop. This is like the driver of the car.\n\nWithout hardware, software can’t run. And without software, hardware is just a useless box of circuits. That’s why they must work together!\n\nBy 2030, the global software industry is expected to hit $1 trillion, and without software, we wouldn't have things like AI, mobile apps, or even this video you’re watching right now!

It’s great for gaming and business.\nmacOS is sleek and optimized for Apple devices, used by about 15% of users, mostly professionals and creatives.\nLinux is the king of servers, running 90% of cloud infrastructure, and it’s completely free and open-source!\nWithout an OS, your computer wouldn’t even boot up!

Let’s break it down—super simple!\"\"  \r\n<b style='display: block;'>[0:10-0:30] What is it?</b><br>\r\n\"\"CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. Think of it as the brain of your device. Every time you open an app, play a game, or even scroll a video, the CPU is the one crunching the numbers. In 2023 alone, over 400 million CPUs were shipped worldwide—that’s how essential they are!\"\"  \r\n<b style='display: block;'>[0:30-1:00] How it works</b><br>\r\n\"\"Here’s the cool part: the CPU works in three steps. First, it fetches instructions—like, ‘Hey, open this app.’ Then, it decodes them, figuring out what to do. Finally, it executes—making it happen lightning-fast. Modern CPUs can handle billions of these cycles per second. For example, a typical phone CPU today runs at 2-3 GHz—that’s 2 to 3 billion cycles every second!\"\"  \r\n<b style='display: block;'>[1:00-1:30] Fun fact</b><br>\r\n\"\"Back in 1971, the first CPU, the Intel 4004, could only do 92,000 operations per second.
